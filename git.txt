Git is a distributed version control system widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Created by Linus Torvalds, it allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. Git enables users to create branches, merge changes, and maintain a detailed history of code modifications. It is known for its speed, flexibility, and ability to handle both small and large-scale projects, making it a crucial tool in software development for version management and collaboration.
