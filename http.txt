HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a fundamental protocol of the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, enabling the exchange of information between a web server and a client (usually a web browser). HTTP facilitates the retrieval and display of web content, supporting the structure of links and multimedia elements on websites. It operates over the Internet, allowing users to access and interact with various online resources.
